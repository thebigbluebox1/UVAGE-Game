#Game Description:
# A catch game with two players. Items will drop down from the top of the screen and the players will catch them for points.
# There will be different items that drop worth different points. One player may lose all their hp and be unable to play
# while the other is still able to play and get points. The winner of each level will be displayed at the end of the round.
# A certain amount of points will be needed to advance to the next level. Players can redo any level they have completed
# to gain enough points to advance to the next level. For example, if you need 3000 points to advance to level 3,
# players can redo levels 1 and 2 to get enough points.


# Basic Features:
#1- Both the players can use the a/d or left/right arrow keys to move their basket to catch items. This will allow them to gain points

#2- There will be a health bar for each player. When a player fails to catch a certain amount of items, they will 'die'
# as each item the player fails to catch causes the player to lose hp. If both run out of hp, neither can play anymore.

#3- We will import and basket and fruit images to use as the player's catch item and the items that drop down for them to catch.


#Additional Features:
#1- Two players: We will have to players playing the game. Each will have half of the screen. One can lose all their hp and not be able to play
# while the other still can. Both must work together to gain enough points to advance to the next level.

#2- Health bar: Each player will have a health bar. The players need to catch enough fruits without losing all their hp so they can go to
# the next level.

#3- Multiple levels: Each time the players get enough points, they can go to the next level. Each time they advance, the speed at which the items drop
# increases, making it harder for each player to catch the items.

#4- Save points: Because the players need a certain amount of points to advance levels and will likely not get them in their first try of the level
# we will allow the players to go back to any previous level to get more points. This will be a screen at the end of each level asking the players
# if they want to completely restart the game (back to level 1), go back to a previous level, or advance to the next level if possible.
